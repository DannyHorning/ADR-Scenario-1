<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>As part of developing the retail mobile app, we need to choose a push notification service to notify users about order updates, new product arrivals, exclusive offers, and other relevant information. Selecting the right push notification service is crucial for ensuring timely and effective communication with users.</p>
<h2 id="decision">Decision</h2>
<p>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)</p>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<p>FCM provides cross-platform support, enabling us to send push notifications to both Android and iOS devices.<br>
This ensures consistent communication with users across different mobile platforms, enhancing the reach and effectiveness of push notifications. By integrating Firebase Cloud Messaging as the push notification service for the retail mobile app, several benefits, including cross-platform support, reliability, scalability, rich notification features, and integration with the Firebase ecosystem will become available. However, it’s essential to ensure proper configuration, monitoring, and optimization of push notifications to deliver relevant and timely messages to users while respecting their preferences and privacy settings. With proactive management and optimization, FCM enables us to effectively communicate with users and enhance their overall experience with the retail mobile app.</p>
