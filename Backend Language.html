<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>The app in development is a retail store, that also needs to work in an “offline” mode. Push notifications should be a feature, as well as some sort of storage base. Analytical tools will be needed to track the apps efficiency. It’s crucial to decide on the programming language to build the server-side logic, handle database interactions, and manage business logic. This decision significantly impacts factors such as scalability, performance, maintainability, and ecosystem support.</p>
<h2 id="decision">Decision</h2>
<p>Node.js (Javascript)</p>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<p>Node.js leverages JavaScript, a widely adopted language with a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools. This familiarity and abundance of resources streamline development, facilitate code reuse, and accelerate the implementation of features. Using Node.js for the backend enables full-stack JavaScript development, allowing developers to work seamlessly across the frontend and backend layers. This alignment promotes code consistency, simplifies collaboration between frontend and backend teams, and enhances overall development efficiency. However, it’s essential to consider factors such as asynchronous programming challenges, resource management, and security best practices to ensure the robustness and reliability of the backend infrastructure.</p>
