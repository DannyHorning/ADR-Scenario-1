<p>Proposed</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>The app will allow customers to browse and purchase products, view their order history, and track the status of their deliveries. Additionally, the app will have a loyalty program feature, where customers can earn and redeem points for discounts on future purchases. The app must be accessible by phone, as well as online. Some of the proposed features of the app would work best on mobile, such as the push notifications. Storage capabilities may work best with a web app.</p>
<h2 id="decision">Decision</h2>
<p>Hybrid App</p>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<p>Combining the features of the web and mobile development will allow for the app to work at its best. While maintenance may be more complex than developing for purely mobile, but the storage capabilities and speed of development of a hybrid app will more than make up for the difference.</p>
