<p>Proposed</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>The choice of database technology is critical to efficiently store and manage structured data such as user profiles, product catalogs, order information, and analytics data. Considering the requirements of the retail company and the scalability needs of the app, we need to decide on a suitable SQL database solution</p>
<h2 id="decision">Decision</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL</p>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL offers a comprehensive set of features, including support for complex queries, data types, indexing options, and transaction management. Its advanced capabilities, such as JSONB data type for semi-structured data and full-text search, accommodate diverse data storage and retrieval needs of the retail app. This will work well with the implementation of the React Native framework we have previously chosen. PostgreSQL is highly scalable, capable of handling large volumes of data and concurrent transactions.</p>
