<p>Proposed</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>The app in development is a retail store, that also needs to work in an “offline” mode. Push notifications should be a feature, as well as some sort of storage base. Analytical tools will be needed to track the apps efficiency.</p>

<p>React Native</p>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<p>React Native allows for the development of cross-platform apps, enabling us to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms.<br>
This approach streamlines development efforts and ensures consistency in user experience across different devices. React Native has extensive support for integrating with third-party services and APIs, crucial for features such as push notifications, payment gateways, and analytics. This flexibility enables seamless integration of various functionalities into the app. However, it is essential to remain mindful of potential challenges such as platform-specific differences, performance optimizations, and dependency on third-party libraries.</p>
