<p>Proposed</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>The app in development is a retail store, that also needs to work in an “offline” mode. Push notifications should be a feature, as well as some sort of storage base. Analytical tools will be needed to track the apps efficiency.  It will be imperative to establish a robust permissions management system to ensure the security of user data and protect user privacy. Determining how permissions are requested, handled, and managed within the app is essential for providing users with transparency and control over their data</p>
<h2 id="decision">Decision</h2>
<p>A <strong>granular permissions system</strong> that requests user consent for specific functionalities within the retail mobile app</p>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<p>Granular permissions empower users by providing transparency and control over the data they share with the app. By clearly communicating the purpose of each permission request, users can make informed decisions about granting or denying access to their data. -   Granular permissions help mitigate security risks by limiting access to sensitive device features and data. By restricting access to only essential functionalities, the app reduces the attack surface and strengthens its overall security posture.</p>
